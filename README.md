Challenge 1

Deployed Website - https://victormendez96.github.io/VMChallenge1/

User Story : 
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Fixes : 
- Unnecessary divs removed throughout HTML to make code more accessible
- Fixed CSS code to be easier to edit in the future
- Changed way image was inserted for Cover photo. Kept in own div "hero" and removed CSS code for background image
